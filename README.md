```lrc
[00:17.99] I don't live in a time
[00:21.92] Where the truth prevails
[00:25.94] Things just seem to happen
[00:29.92] On an escalating scale
[00:40.92] 
[00:34.31] They play you for a fool
[00:38.37] To weaken your resolve
[00:42.96] Drowning you in details
[00:47.26] To make you miss the whole
[01:00.26] 
[00:51.51] Sunbeams and forget-me-nots
[00:56.08] Beads of amber, parking lots
[01:00.02] From your view, you see a lot
[01:04.39] What you really see
[01:08.73] Forest for the trees
[01:18.73] 
[01:30.32] I don't live in a world
[01:34.47] Big on clarity
[01:38.80] The way it's coming at us
[01:42.91] So relentlessly
[01:50.41] 
[01:47.22] Where does one thing end
[01:51.52] And the next one start
[01:55.83] Where to begin
[01:59.80] To keep it all apart
[02:09.80] 
[02:04.50] Sunbeams and forget-me-nots
[02:08.97] Keys are in the flower pot
[02:12.96] A rider brings his horse to trot
[02:17.14] All is lost on me
[02:21.81] Forest for the trees
[02:31.81] 
[02:43.37] Sunbeams and forget-me-nots
[02:47.31] Awoken by a rifle shot
[02:51.62] From your view, you see a lot
[02:55.94] But never the whole piece
[03:00.45] Forest for the trees
[03:10.45] 
[03:04.51] We're running out of movieplots
[03:08.96] Your stomach's tied into a knot
[03:13.28] Crackles as the needle drops
[03:16.93] On a somber melody
[03:21.66] A heartbreak elegy
[03:25.85] Unsurprisingly
[03:29.69] Called "Forest for the trees"
[03:44.19] 
[03:40.83] Oooh, aaah...
